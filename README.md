# Quick WebApp Launcher

Your personalized project launcher for organizing and quickly accessing your creative tools and projects.

## Description:

My Creation Hub is a simple web-based application designed to help you keep track of your various programs, scripts, games, and other creative assets. It allows you to add entries for each item, providing a name, description, and a "launch command" (simulated in this web version). You can easily reorder your entries via drag-and-drop, and the data is saved automatically in your browser's local storage. You can also export and import your hub data.

**Please Note:** This is a web simulation. The "Launch Command" functionality is simulated within the browser and does not actually execute programs on your local machine.

## Features:

* **Add New Programs:** Easily add new entries for your programs or projects.

* **Edit Programs:** Modify existing program details.

* **Delete Programs:** Remove programs from your list.

* **Drag and Drop Reordering:** Organize your programs by dragging the cards.

* **Automatic Saving:** Your program list is automatically saved to your browser's LocalStorage.

* **Export Data:** Save your program list as a JSON file for backup or transfer.

* **Import Data:** Load a previously exported JSON file to restore your program list.

* **Icon Selection:** Choose from a few predefined icons to represent your programs.

* **File Pre-fill:** Optionally select a file to pre-fill the name and launch command fields (remember to verify the full path for actual use).

* **Help Section:** Provides guidance on finding launch commands for different operating systems (simulated context).

## Usage:

This project is a static web application. To run it:

1. Save the three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) in the same folder on your computer.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

That's it! The application should load directly in your browser.
